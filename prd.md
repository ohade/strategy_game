Hereâ€™s a **deeper dive** into how the LLM part should work, and how it connects to your AI engine:

---

# 1. **Purpose of the LLM in Your Game**

The LLM's role is *not* to control ships directly.  
Its role is to **translate** free-text player instructions into a **structured action plan**.  
The **AI engine** will then use the action plan to decide **what the ships actually do**.

**Separation**:  
- **LLM** = *Interpretation layer* (from messy human language to clean structured plan).  
- **AI Engine** = *Execution layer* (follow the structured plan logically and consistently).

---

# 2. **Flow Overview**

**Step 1:** Player writes a free-text mission (example:  
*"Find the enemy base, engage lightly, limit losses to 30%, retreat in a roundabout way."*)

**Step 2:** The LLM processes the text into a structured command object, like:

```json
{
  "mission": "reconnaissance",
  "primary_goal": "locate_enemy_base",
  "engagement": "light_skirmish",
  "max_losses_percent": 30,
  "retreat_mode": "indirect_path"
}
```

**Step 3:** Your AI engine reads this structure and:
- Defines **movement strategy** (e.g., slower, stealthier approach).
- Defines **combat rules** (e.g., don't engage heavily, run if losses hit 30%).
- Defines **retreat behavior** (e.g., randomized retreat vector, not a straight line).

# 3. **How to Build It in Detail**

## 3.1 Define Structured Command Schema
Before anything, define what your **action plan format** looks like.
Examples of fields:

| Field | Meaning | Example |
|:----|:----|:----|
| `mission` | What is the mission? | reconnaissance, assault, defend |
| `primary_goal` | Specific goal | locate enemy base, protect convoy |
| `engagement` | How aggressive to be | no engagement, light skirmish, full assault |
| `max_losses_percent` | Allowed losses before abort | 10, 20, 30% |
| `retreat_mode` | How to retreat | direct path, evasive path, stealth retreat |
| `priority_targets` | (Optional) focus fire on something | enemy scouts, heavy ships |

You can expand this later, but start small.

## 3.2 Build Prompts for the LLM
Your prompt should **tell the LLM clearly**:
- You want a JSON output.
- You want it to stick to your field names.
- You want it to guess best if information is missing.

**Example LLM system prompt:**

> "You are a mission command interpreter.  
> Given a free-text mission order, extract the following fields into JSON: mission, primary_goal, engagement, max_losses_percent, retreat_mode, priority_targets (optional).  
> Be strict about format. If data is missing, infer if possible, or leave it blank."

---

## 3.3 Example Input/Output

**Input to LLM** (player free text):

> "Send a scouting group to find the enemy base.  
> Engage lightly if necessary, avoid big fights.  
> No more than 30% losses.  
> If you retreat, don't come straight back to us."

**Output JSON from LLM**:

```json
{
  "mission": "reconnaissance",
  "primary_goal": "locate_enemy_base",
  "engagement": "light_skirmish",
  "max_losses_percent": 30,
  "retreat_mode": "indirect_path",
  "priority_targets": ""
}
```

# 4. **How Your AI Engine Will Use It**

Once you have the structured object:

| Field | AI Engine Action |
|:-----|:-----------------|
| mission = reconnaissance | Move in scanning mode, avoid detection. |
| engagement = light_skirmish | Only engage weak enemies if needed, avoid heavy fight. |
| max_losses_percent = 30% | Track unit health; retreat if losses approach limit. |
| retreat_mode = indirect_path | Choose random/safe retreat vector, not toward home base. |

Your AI can be simple at first:
- Predefine "rules" for each mission type.
- Use the fields to **modulate** AI decisions (move speed, engagement willingness, retreat behavior).

---

# 5. **Summary**

| Layer | Responsibility |
|:---|:---|
| LLM | Understand messy human instructions and output a clean plan. |
| AI Engine | Execute the clean plan with simple logic and state tracking. |

The **power** comes from:
- Letting the player use flexible language.
- Keeping the AI predictable and reliable, following the structured command.

---

# 6. **Minimal Working Prototype Suggestion**

**MVP setup**:
- One LLM call to parse free text to structured JSON.
- One dummy AI that moves ships and prints/logs: "Searching... Skirmishing... Retreating via evasive path..." according to the JSON plan.

Later you expand:
- Real physics.
- Real combat.
- Smarter AI planning.
