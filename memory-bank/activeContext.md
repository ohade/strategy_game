# Active Context

## Current Focus
The current focus is on the Carrier Implementation phase of the project. Based on the track-work.md file, several carrier-related tasks have been completed, including:
- Carrier core definition and movement
- Collision system enhancements for carriers
- Fighter management system (partially complete)
- Player controls for carrier operations (partially complete)
- Orderly launch sequencing (completed)

The next tasks to be implemented include:
- Ordered landing sequence controller
- Collision detection during operations
- Carrier movement restrictions
- Carrier UI and controls
- Landing and docking system
- Repair system for docked units

[2025-05-07 16:52:34] - Updated after completing orderly launch sequencing

## Recent Changes
- Implementation of the Carrier class with Battlestar Galactica-inspired design
- Mass-based collision resolution for carrier interactions
- Fighter storage, launch points, and launch mechanics
- Player-initiated fighter launches and return-to-carrier commands
- Sequential one-by-one launch procedure with queue management system
- Test-driven development of orderly launch sequencing functionality

[2025-05-07 16:52:34] - Added sequential launch procedure implementation

## Open Questions/Issues
1. How should the landing sequence be implemented to ensure smooth animations and proper state transitions?
2. What visual indicators should be used for fighters targeted to land?
3. How should the carrier movement be restricted during active landing/takeoff operations?
4. What's the best approach for handling collision detection toggling during landing operations?
5. How should the repair system prioritize damaged fighters?
