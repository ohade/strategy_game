# Decision Log

## Architecture Decisions

### [2025-05-07 16:30:30] - Modular Code Structure
- **Decision**: Organize code into separate modules by functionality
- **Rationale**: Improves maintainability, readability, and testability
- **Implications**: Requires clear interfaces between modules, but enables parallel development and easier debugging

### [2025-05-07 16:30:30] - Test-Driven Development Approach
- **Decision**: Follow strict TDD methodology for all new features
- **Rationale**: Ensures code quality, prevents regressions, and documents expected behavior
- **Implications**: Development may initially be slower, but produces more robust code with fewer bugs

### [2025-05-07 16:30:30] - Carrier as Extended Unit Type
- **Decision**: Implement Carrier as a subclass of FriendlyUnit
- **Rationale**: Reuses existing movement and combat mechanics while adding specialized carrier functionality
- **Implications**: May require special case handling for certain interactions, but maintains consistency in the unit system

### [2025-05-07 16:30:30] - Mass-Based Collision System
- **Decision**: Implement collision resolution based on unit mass
- **Rationale**: Creates more realistic interactions between units of different sizes
- **Implications**: Larger units like carriers will push smaller units, creating more dynamic gameplay

### [2025-05-07 16:30:30] - Multi-Stage Landing Sequence
- **Decision**: Implement landing as a state machine with multiple stages
- **Rationale**: Creates more realistic and visually appealing landing operations
- **Implications**: More complex code but better player experience

## Implementation Decisions

### [2025-05-07 16:30:30] - Sprite-Based Rendering
- **Decision**: Replace geometric shapes with sprite-based rendering
- **Rationale**: Improves visual appeal and allows for more detailed unit representation
- **Implications**: Requires additional asset management but significantly enhances game aesthetics

### [2025-05-07 16:30:30] - Configurable Launch Points
- **Decision**: Implement launch points as configurable positions on carrier
- **Rationale**: Allows for realistic fighter launch locations and visual effects
- **Implications**: More complex launch logic but better visual representation

### [2025-05-07 16:30:30] - Selection Preview During Drag
- **Decision**: Add preview_selected state to units for visual feedback during selection drag
- **Rationale**: Improves user experience by showing which units will be selected before releasing the mouse button
- **Implications**: Requires additional state tracking but enhances usability
